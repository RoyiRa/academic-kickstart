Hello! I am a first year PhD student in the [Natural Language Processing Lab](https://biu-nlp.github.io/) at Bar-Ilan University, supervised by [prof. Yoav Goldberg](https://u.cs.biu.ac.il/~yogo/). In this space I get to share my passion for research and real-world applications in NLP and machine learning.

During my MSc, I was driven by my fascination with underspecified language. Why do models often misinterpret ambiguous language, and we don't? How can we make implicit information more explicit? My thesis work (under review) aimed to answer these questions in the context of verbal omissions in coordination structures and creating a dataset and task to resolve these omissions. As a fun detour, I stumbled upon intriguing behavior by DALL-E when fed with ambiguous language, where it depicts multiple interpretations in a single image, instead of settling on one. We detailed this behavior in a short [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10606).

My CV is available [here](cv/cv.pdf).
