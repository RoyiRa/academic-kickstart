I am a second year master's student in the Natural Language Processing Lab at Bar-Ilan University, suprvised by [prof. Yoav Goldberg](https://www.cs.bgu.ac.il/~yoavg/uni/) and a reserch intern in AI2 Israel.

I am interested in representation learning, analysis and interpretability of neural models, and the syntactic abilities of NNs.
