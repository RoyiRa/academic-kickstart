abstract: "Text-to-image (T2I) models are remarkable at generating realistic images based on textual descriptions. However, textual prompts are inherently underspecified: they do not specify all possible attributes of the required image. This raises two key questions: Do T2I models generate diverse outputs on underspecified prompts? How can we automatically measure diversity? We propose GRADE: Granular Attribute Diversity Evaluation, an automatic method for quantifying sample diversity. GRADE leverages the world knowledge embedded in large language models and visual question-answering systems to identify relevant concept-specific axes of diversity (e.g., ``shape'' and ``color'' for the concept ``cookie''). It then estimates frequency distributions of concepts and their attributes and quantifies diversity using (normalized) entropy. GRADE achieves over 90% human agreement while exhibiting weak correlation to commonly used diversity metrics. We use GRADE to measure the overall diversity of 12 T2I models using 400 concept-attribute pairs, revealing that all models display limited variation. Further, we find that these models often exhibit default behaviors, a phenomenon where the model consistently generates concepts with the same attributes (e.g., 98% of the cookies are round). Finally, we demonstrate that a key reason for low diversity is due to underspecified captions in training data. Our work proposes a modern, semantically-driven approach to measure sample diversity and highlights the stunning homogeneity in outputs by T2I models."



# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: "We introduce GRADE, a method for assessing the output diversity of images generated by text-to-image models. Using LLMs and Visual-QA systems, GRADE quantifies diversity across concept-specific attributes by estimating attribute distributions and calculating normalized entropy."
